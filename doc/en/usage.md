# Usage

Create one or more templates directories, and create pug
files in them.

For example, imagine that **myView.pug** is in the
**views/directory** directory and contains:

```phug
h1=$title
```
```vars
[
  'title' => 'Header',
]
```

You can display the matching HTML of this file like this:
```php
<?php

include_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$variables = [
   'title' => 'Header',
];

$options = [
  'paths' => [
    'views/directory',
  ],
];

Phug::displayFile('myView', $variables, $options);
```

We recommend to use `displayFile` as much as possible for
performances (`displayFile` is faster than
`echo renderFile`) and files can be cached faster than a
raw content so in production
`displayFile('myView.pug')` is faster than
`display('the content of the file')`.

In production, we also recommend to use the *Optimizer*
and the cache:

```php
<?php

include_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

// Replace with your own environment calculation
$environment = getenv('ENVIRONMENT') ?: 'production';

$variables = [
   'title' => 'Header',
];

$options = [
  'debug'     => false,
  'cache_dir' => 'cache/directory', 
  'paths'     => [
    'views/directory',
  ],
];

if ($environment === 'production') {
    \Phug\Optimizer::call('displayFile', ['myView', $variables], $options);

    exit;
}

$options['debug'] = true;
$options['cache_dir'] = null;

Phug::displayFile('myView', $variables, $options);
```

The *Optimizer* is a tool that avoid to load the Phug engine
if a file is available in the cache. In counterpart, it
does not allow to change the adapter or user post-render
events.

If you use **Pug-php**, just replace in the code above
`\Phug\Optimizer` with `\Pug\Optimizer` and
`Phug::displayFile` with `\Pug\Facade::displayFile`.

The cache can be used in development too to save time.
This may cause some tracking issue when errors occurs in
yet rendered templates but this bug should be fixed soon.

In production, you should use the `--optimize-autoloader`
option of composer to optimize the autoloader when installing
dependencies. Then you should cache all your templates to
get benefit of the
[`up_to_date_check` option](#up-to-date-check-boolean)

```shell
composer update --optimize-autoloader
./vendor/bin/phug compile-directory views/directory cache/directory '{"debug":"false"}'
```

By doing this for each deployment on your server,
you will be able to set `up_to_date_check` option to `true`
to directly load cache file with no file check.

See [CLI](#cli) for more informations about the
command line.
