# Language reference

As **Phug** aims to be pugjs compliant, the language reference
is nearly the same as the one you can find for
[pugjs](https://pugjs.org) and this chapter follow the pugjs
one content except for **Phug** specificities and live code
editors that allows you to test with the **Phug** engine.

## Attributes

Tag attributes look similar to HTML (with optional commas),
but their values are just expressions.

```phug
a(href='google.com') Google
="\n"
a(class='button' href='google.com') Google
="\n"
a(class='button', href='google.com') Google
```

(`="\n"` are just here to add whitespace between links for an
easier reading of the output HTML).

Normal PHP expressions work fine by default on **Phug** and
**Tale-pug**; and on **Pug-php** with `expressionLanguage`
option set to `php`:
```phug
- $authenticated = true
body(class=$authenticated ? 'authed' : 'anon')
```

Normal JavaScript expressions work fine too with **js-phpize-phug**
extension installed ([see how to install](#use-javascript-expressions))
or **Pug-php** last version with default options (or `expressionLanguage`
set to `js`):
```pug
- var authenticated = true
body(class=authenticated ? 'authed' : 'anon')
```

### Multiline Attributes

If you have many attributes, you can also spread them across many
lines:
```phug
input(
  type='checkbox'
  name='agreement'
  checked
)
```

Multiline texts are not at all a problem either you use JS or PHP
expressions:
```pug
input(data-json='
  {
    "very-long": "piece of ",
    "data": true
  }
')
```

Note: if you migrate templates from a JavaScript project you might
have to replace <code>&#96;</code> by simple quotes `'` or double
quotes `"`.

### Quoted Attributes

If your attribute name contains odd characters that might interfere
with expressions syntax, either quote it using `""` or `''`, or use
commas to separate different attributes. Examples of such characters
include `[]` and `()` (frequently used in Angular 2).

```phug
//- In this case, `[click]` is treated
//- as an offset getter, resulting
//- in the unusual error.
div(class='div-class' [click]='play()')
```

```phug
div(class='div-class', [click]='play()')
div(class='div-class' '[click]'='play()')
```

### Attribute Interpolation

A small note about a syntax you may hav known in **pugjs 1**:
`a(href="/#{url}") Link`, this syntax is no longer valid in **pugjs 2**
and so we decided to not support it in **Phug**. You can PHP
interpolation:
```phug
- $btnType = 'info'
- $btnSize = 'lg'
button(type="button" class="btn btn-$btnType btn-$btnSize")
- $btn = (object) ['size' => 'lg']
button(type="button" class="btn btn-{$btn->size}")
```
For JS expressions, use concatenation `" + btnType + "`.

### Unescaped Attributes

By default, all attributes are escaped to prevent attacks (such as
cross site scripting). If you need to use special characters,
use `!=` instead of `=`.
```phug
div(escaped="&lt;code>")
div(unescaped!="&lt;code>")
```

**Caution, unescaped buffered code can be dangerous.** You must be
sure to sanitize any user inputs to avoid
[cross-site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).

### Unchecked attributes

Here is a specific concept of **Phug** you would not find in **pugjs**,
it's about checking a variable exist.

In PHP, when error are displayed and error level enable notices, calling
a non-existing variable will throw an error.

By default, we will hide those error, but this could hide some bug, so
you can use `?=` operator to avoid this behavior:

```phug
- $wrong = ''
img(src?=$wronk)
```
In this example, the `?=` operator will reveal the miss typo of "wrong".
Click on the `[Preview]` button to see the error.

Attributes can be both unchecked and unescaped:

```phug
- $html = '&lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>'
img(alt?!=$html)
```

To disable globally the checking (always throw an error if the variable
called is not defined), use the `php_token_handlers` option:

```php
Phug::setOption(['php_token_handlers', T_VARIABLE], null);
```

### Boolean Attributes

Boolean attributes are mirrored by **Phug**. Boolean values (`true` and
`false`) are accepted. When no value is specified `true` is assumed.
```phug
input(type='checkbox' checked)
="\n"
input(type='checkbox' checked=true)
="\n"
input(type='checkbox' checked=false)
="\n"
input(type='checkbox' checked='true')
```

If the doctype is `html`, **Phug** knows not to mirror the attribute,
and instead uses the terse style (understood by all browsers).
```phug
doctype html
="\n"
input(type='checkbox' checked)
="\n"
input(type='checkbox' checked=true)
="\n"
input(type='checkbox' checked=false)
="\n"
input(type='checkbox' checked='checked')
```

### Style Attributes

The `style` attribute can be a string, like any normal attribute; but
it can also be an object or an array.

PHP-style:
```phug
a(style=['color' => 'red', 'background' => 'green'])
="\n"
a(style=(object)['color' => 'red', 'background' => 'green'])
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
a(style={color: 'red', background: 'green'})
```

### Class Attributes

The `class` attribute can be a string, like any normal attribute;
but it can also be an array of class names, which is handy when
generated.
```phug
- $classes = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
a(class=$classes)
="\n"
//- the class attribute may also be repeated to merge arrays
a.bang(class=$classes class=['bing'])
```

It can also be an array which maps class names to `true` or
`false` values. This is useful for applying conditional classes.

PHP-style:
```pug
- $currentUrl = '/about'
a(ref='/' class=['active' => $currentUrl === '/']) Home
="\n"
a(href='/about' class=['active' => $currentUrl === '/about']) About
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
- var currentUrl = '/about'
a(href='/' class={active: currentUrl === '/'}) Home
="\n"
a(href='/about' class={active: currentUrl === '/about'}) About
```

### Class Literal

Classes may be defined using a `.classname` syntax:
```phug
a.button
```

Since `div`'s are such a common choice of tag, it is the
default if you omit the tag name:
```phug
.content
```

### ID Literal

IDs may be defined using a `#idname` syntax:
```phug
a#main-link
```

Since `div`'s are such a common choice of tag,
it is the default if you omit the tag name:
```phug
#content
```

### &attributes

Pronounced as “and attributes”, the `&attributes` syntax can
be used to explode an array into attributes of an element.

PHP-style:
```phug
div#foo(data-bar="foo")&attributes(['data-foo' => 'bar'])
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
div#foo(data-bar="foo")&attributes({'data-foo': 'bar'})
```

The above examples uses an array literal. But you can also use
a variable whose value is an array, too. (See also:
[Mixin Attributes](#mixin-attributes)).
```phug
- $attributes = []
- $attributes['class'] = 'baz'
div#foo(data-bar="foo")&attributes($attributes)
```

**Caution, attributes applied using `&attributes` are not
automatically escaped.** You must be sure to sanitize any user
inputs to avoid
[cross-site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)
(XSS). If passing in `attributes` from a mixin call, this is
done automatically.

## Case

The `case` statement is a shorthand for the PHP `switch` statement.
It takes the following form:

```phug
- $friends = 10
case $friends
  when 0
    p you have no friends
  when 1
    p you have a friend
  default
    p you have #{$friends} friends
```

### Case Fall Through

You can use fall through, just as you would in a PHP `switch` statement.

```phug
- $friends = 0
case $friends
  when 0
  when 1
    p you have very few friends
  default
    p you have #{$friends} friends
```

The difference, however, is a fall through in PHP happens whenever a
`break` statement is not explicitly included; in **Phug**, it only happens
when a block is completely missing.

If you would like to not output anything in a specific case, add an explicit
unbuffered `break`:

```phug
- $friends = 0
case $friends
  when 0
    - break
  when 1
    p you have very few friends
  default
    p you have #{$friends} friends
```

### Block Expansion

Block expansion may also be used:

```phug
- $friends = 1
case $friends
  when 0: p you have no friends
  when 1: p you have a friend
  default: p you have #{$friends} friends
```

## Code

**Phug** allows you to write inline PHP or JavaScript code in
your templates. The code can be buffered or not. When it is
buffered, it can be escaped or not, checked or not the same
way as attributes.

### Unbuffered Code

Unbuffered code starts with `-`. It does not directly add
anything to the output.

```phug
- for ($x = 0; $x &lt; 3; $x++)
  li item
```

**Phug** also supports block unbuffered code:

```phug
-
  $list = ["Uno", "Dos", "Tres",
          "Cuatro", "Cinco", "Seis"]
each $item in $list
  li= $item
```

### Buffered Code

Buffered code starts with `=`. It evaluates the PHP or JavaScript
expression and outputs the result.
For security, buffered code is first HTML escaped.

```phug
p
  = 'This code is &lt;escaped>!'
```

It can also be written inline, and supports the full range of
expressions:

```phug
p= 'This code is' . ' &lt;escaped>!'
```

Note: if you use JavaScript expressions, concatenations must use
the `+` operator:

```pug
p= 'This code is' + ' &lt;escaped>!'
```

### Unescape/escape code

Precede the `=` with `!` to not escape HTML entities, with `?`
to not check variables to be set and `?!` for both:

```phug
- $start = '&lt;strong>'
- $end = '&lt;/strong>'
//- This one is escaped
div= $start . 'Word' . $end
//- This one is not escaped
div!= $start . 'Word' . $end
//- Both are checked
div= 'start' . $middle . 'end'
div!= 'start' . $middle . 'end'
```

### Uncheck/check code

Checked code does not throw an error when variables are
undefined.

Unchecked code throws an error when variables are
undefined. See the examples below with on the one hand
an existing variable, and on the other hand a missing
variable:
```phug
- $middle = ' middle '
div?= 'start' . $middle . 'end'
div?!= 'start' . $middle . 'end'
```

```phug
div?= 'start' . $middle . 'end'
div?!= 'start' . $middle . 'end'
```

**Caution: unescaped buffered code can be dangerous.** You must
be sure to sanitize any user inputs to avoid
[cross-site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)
(XSS).

## Commentaires

Buffered comments look the same as single-line JavaScript comments.
They act sort of like markup tags, producing *HTML* comments in the
rendered page.

Like tags, buffered comments must appear on their own line.

```phug
// just some paragraphs
p foo
p bar
// each line
// will produce
// a HTML comment
footer
```

**Phug** also supports unbuffered comments (they will be not compiled
so you can add many with no impact on the cache file size).
Simply add a hyphen (`-`) to the start of the comment.

```phug
//- will not output within markup
p foo
p bar
```

### Block Comments

Block comments work, too:
```phug
body
  //-
    Comments for your template writers.
    Use as much text as you want.
  //
    Comments for your HTML readers.
    Use as much text as you want.
```

### Conditional Comments

**Phug** does not have any special syntax for conditional comments.
(Conditional comments are a peculiar method of adding fallback
markup for old versions of Internet Explorer.)

However, since all lines beginning with `<` are treated as [plain
text](#plain-text), normal HTML-style conditional comments work
just fine.
```phug
doctype html

&lt;!--[if IE 8]>
&lt;html lang="fr" class="lt-ie9">
&lt;![endif]-->
&lt;!--[if gt IE 8]>&lt;!-->
&lt;html lang="fr">
&lt;!--&lt;![endif]-->

body
  p Supporting old web browsers is a pain.

&lt;/html>
```

## Conditionals

Conditionals look like the following if you use PHP-style:
```phug
- $user = [ 'description' => 'foo bar baz' ]
- $authorised = false
#user
  if $user['description']
    h2.green Description
    p.description= $user['description']
  else if $authorised
    h2.blue Description
    p.description.
      User has no description,
      why not add one...
  else
    h2.red Description
    p.description User has no description
```

If you [use JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
- var user = { description: 'foo bar baz' }
- var authorised = false
#user
  if user.description
    h2.green Description
    p.description= user.description
  else if authorised
    h2.blue Description
    p.description.
      User has no description,
      why not add one...
  else
    h2.red Description
    p.description User has no description
```

**Note:** When using [JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions), multiple conditionals such as `if truthy && truthy` or `if falsy && falsy` do not work as expected (See [this issue](https://github.com/pug-php/pug/issues/216)). You will need to wrap each statement in parentheses, eg `if (truthy) && (falsy)`

**Phug** also provides the conditional `unless`, which works
like a negated `if`.

PHP-style example:
```phug
unless $user['isAnonymous']
  p You're logged in as #{$user['name']}.
//- is equivalent to
if !$user['isAnonymous']
  p You're logged in as #{$user['name']}.
```
```vars
[
  'user' => [
    'isAnonymous' => false,
    'name' => 'Jefferson Airplane',
  ],
]
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions) example:
```pug
unless user.isAnonymous
  p You're logged in as #{user.name}.
//- is equivalent to
if !user.isAnonymous
  p You're logged in as #{user.name}.
```
```vars
[
  'user' => [
    'isAnonymous' => false,
    'name' => 'Jefferson Airplane',
  ],
]
```

## Doctype

```phug
doctype html
```

### Doctype Shortcuts

Shortcuts to commonly used doctypes:

```phug
doctype html
doctype xml
doctype transitional
doctype strict
doctype frameset
doctype 1.1
doctype basic
doctype mobile
doctype plist
```

### Custom Doctypes

You can also use your own literal custom doctype:

```phug
doctype html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.1//EN"
```

### Doctype Option

In addition to being buffered in the output, a doctype in **Phug**
can affect compilation in other ways. For example, whether
self-closing tags end with `/>` or `>` depends on whether HTML
or XML is specified. The output of
[boolean attributes](#booleens-attributes)
may be affected as well.

If, for whatever reason, it is not possible to use the `doctype`
keyword (e.g., just rendering HTML fragments), but you would
still like to specify the doctype of the template, you can do
so via the [doctype option](#doctype-string).

```php
$source = 'img(src="foo.png")';

Phug::render($source);
// => '<img src="foo.png"/>'

Phug::render($source, [], [
  'doctype' => 'xml',
]);
// => '<img src="foo.png"></img>'

Phug::render($source, [], [
  'doctype' => 'html',
]);
// => '<img src="foo.png">'
```

## Filters

Filters let you use other languages in Pug templates. They take a
block of plain text as an input.

To pass options to the filter, add them inside parentheses after
the filter name (just as you would do with
[tag attributes](#attributes)): `:less(compress=false)`.

All [JSTransformer modules](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/jstransformer)
can be used as Pug filters. Popular
filters include :babel, :uglify-js, :scss, and :markdown-it.
Check out the documentation for the JSTransformer for the options
supported for the specific filter.

To use JSTransformer with **Phug**, install the following
extension:

```shell
composer require phug/js-transformer-filter
```

Then enable it:

```php
use Phug\JsTransformerExtension;

Phug::addExtension(JsTransformerExtension::class);
```

With **Pug-php**, this extension is installed and enabled by
default since 3.1.0 version.

You can also use any of the following PHP projects as filter
in all **Phug** and **Pug-php** projects:
http://pug-filters.selfbuild.fr

If you can't find an appropriate filter for your use case, you
can write your own custom filter. It can be any callable (closure,
function or object with __invoke method).

```php
Phug::setFilter('upper-start', function ($inputString, $options) {
  return strtoupper(mb_substr($inputString, 0, $options['length'])).
    mb_substr($inputString, $options['length']);
});

Phug::display('
div
  :upper-start(length=3)
    gggggg
');
```

This will output:
```html
<div>GGGggg</div>
```

The same goes for **Pug-php**:

```php
$pug = new Pug();
$pug->setFilter('upper-start', function ($inputString, $options) {
  return strtoupper(mb_substr($inputString, 0, $options['length'])).
    mb_substr($inputString, $options['length']);
});

$pug->display('
div
  :upper-start(length=3)
    gggggg
');
```

The current compiler is passed as third argument
so you can get any information from it:
```php
Phug::setFilter('path', function ($inputString, $options, CompilerInterface $compiler) {
  return $compiler->getPath();
});

Phug::displayFile('some-template.pug');
```
In this example, if **some-template.pug** contains
`:path` filter calls, it will display the full
path of the current file compiling (example:
**/directory/some-template.pug** or some other
file if called inside an extended/included file).

**Phug** comes with `cdata` filter pre-installed:
```phug
data
  :cdata
    Since this is a CDATA section
    I can use all sorts of reserved characters
    like > &lt; " and &
    or write things like
    &lt;foo>&lt;/bar>
    but my document is still well formed!
```

**Pug-php** pre-install `JsTransformerExtension` and embed `cdata`,
`css`, `escaped`, `javascript`, `php`, `pre`, `script`
and if you not set the `filterAutoLoad` to `false`, it will load
automatically as filter any invokable class in the `Pug\Filter`
namespace:

```pug
doctype html
html
  head
    :css
      a {
        color: red;
      }
  body
    :php
      $calcul = 9 + 8
    p=calcul
    :escaped
      &lt;foo>
    :pre
      div
        h1 Example of Pug code
    :javascript
      console.log('Hello')
    :script
      console.log('Alias of javascript')
```

## Includes

Includes allow you to insert the contents of one Pug file into another.

```phug
//- index.pug
doctype html
html
  include includes/head.pug
  body
    h1 My Site
    p Welcome to my super lame site.
    include includes/foot.pug
```

```phug
//- includes/head.pug
head
  title My Site
  script(src='/javascripts/jquery.js')
  script(src='/javascripts/app.js')
```

```phug
//- includes/foot.pug
footer#footer
  p Copyright (c)
    =date(' Y')
```

If the path is absolute (e.g., `include /root.pug`), it is resolved
from [paths option](#paths-array). This option works like the `basedir` in
pugjs but allow you to specify multiple directories. The `basdir`
option also exists in **Pug-php** to provide full pugjs options
supports but we recommend you prefer `paths`.

Otherwise, paths are resolved relative to the current file being
compiled.

If no file extension is given, `.pug` is automatically appended to
the file name.

### Including Plain Text

Including non-Pug files simply includes their raw text.

```phug
//- index.pug
doctype html
html
  head
    style
      include style.css
  body
    h1 My Site
    p Welcome to my super lame site.
    script
      include script.js
```
```css
/* style.css */
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```
```js
// script.js
console.log('You are awesome');
```

### Including Filtered Text

You can combine filters with includes, allowing you to filter
things as you include them.

```phug
//- index.pug
doctype html
html
  head
    title An article
  body
    include:markdown article.md
```
```markdown
# article.md

This is an article written in markdown.
```

## Template Inheritance

**Phug** supports template inheritance. Template inheritance works
via the `block` and `extends` keywords.

In a template, a `block` is simply a “block” of Pug that a child
template may replace. This process is recursive.

**Phug** blocks can provide default content, if appropriate. Providing
default content is purely optional, though. The example below
defines `block scripts`, `block content`, and `block foot`.

```phug
//- layout.pug
html
  head
    title My Site - #{$title}
    block scripts
      script(src='/jquery.js')
  body
    block content
    block foot
      #footer
        p some footer content
```
```vars
[
  'title' => 'Blog',
]
```
*&#42;No `$` needed if you [use JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions)*

To extend this layout, create a new file and use the `extends`
directive with a path to the parent template. (If no file
extension is given, `.pug` is automatically appended to the
file name.) Then, define one or more blocks to override the
parent block content.

Below, notice that the `foot` block is *not* redefined, so it
will use the parent's default and output “some footer content”.

```phug
//- page-a.pug
extends layout.pug

block scripts
  script(src='/jquery.js')
  script(src='/pets.js')

block content
  h1= $title
  each $petName in $pets
    include pet.pug
```
```vars
[
  'title' => 'Blog',
  'pets'  => ['cat', 'dog']
]
```
```phug
//- pet.pug
p= $petName
```
*&#42;No `$` needed if you [use JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions)*

It's also possible to override a block to provide additional blocks, as
shown in the following example. As it shows, `content` now exposes a
`sidebar` and `primary` block for overriding. (Alternatively, the child
template could override `content` altogether.)

```phug
//- sub-layout.pug
extends layout.pug

block content
  .sidebar
    block sidebar
  .primary
    block primary
```
```phug
//- page-b.pug
extends sub-layout.pug

block sidebar
  p something

block primary
  p something else
```

### Block `append` / `prepend`

**Phug** allows you to `replace` (default), `prepend`, or `append` blocks.

Suppose you have default scripts in a `head` block that you wish to use on
every page, you might do this:

```phug
//- page-layout.pug
html
  head
    block head
      script(src='/vendor/jquery.js')
      script(src='/vendor/caustic.js')
  body
    block content
```

Now, consider a page of your JavaScript game. You want some game related
scripts as well as these defaults. You can simply `append` the block:

```phug
//- page.pug
extends page-layout.pug

block append head
  script(src='/vendor/three.js')
  script(src='/game.js')
```

When using `block append` or `block prepend`, the word “`block`” is
optional:

```phug
//- page.pug
extends page-layout.pug

append head
  script(src='/vendor/three.js')
  script(src='/game.js')
```

### Common mistakes

**Phug**'s template inheritance is a powerful feature that allows you to split
complex page template structures into smaller, simpler files. However,
if you chain many, many templates together, you can make things a lot
more complicated for yourself.

Note that **only named blocks and mixin definitions** can appear at the top
(unindented) level of a child template. This is important! Parent templates
define a page's overall structure, and child templates can only `append`,
`prepend`, or replace specific blocks of markup and logic. If a child
template tried to add content outside of a block, **Phug** would have no way
of knowing where to put it in the final page.

This includes [unbuffered code](#unbuffered-code),
which the placement can have an impact and [buffered comments](#comments) as
they produce HTML comments which would have nowhere to go in the resulting
HTML. (Unbuffered Pug comments, however, can still go anywhere.)

## Interpolation

**Phug** provides operators for a variety of your different interpolative
needs.

### String Interpolation, Escaped

Consider the following code:
```phug
- $title = "On Dogs: Man's Best Friend";
- $author = "enlore";
- $theGreat = "&lt;span>escape!&lt;/span>";

h1= $title
p Written with love by #{$author}
p This will be safe: #{$theGreat}
```

`title` follows the basic pattern for evaluating a template local, but
the code in between `#{` and `}` is evaluated, escaped, and the result
buffered into the output of the template being rendered.

This can be any valid expression, so you can do whatever
feels good.

```phug
- $msg = "not my inside voice";
p This is #{strtoupper($msg)}
```

**Phug** is smart enough to figure out where the expression ends, so you can
even include `}` without escaping.

```phug
p No escaping for #{'}'}!
```

If you need to include a verbatim `#{`, you can either escape it, or use
interpolation.
```phug
p Escaping works with \#{$interpolation}
p Interpolation works with #{'#{$interpolation}'} too!
```

### String Interpolation, Unescaped

```phug
- $riskyBusiness = "&lt;em>Some of the girls are wearing my mother's clothing.&lt;/em>";
.quote
  p Joel: !{$riskyBusiness}
```

**Caution ! Keep in mind that buffering unescaped content into your
templates can be mighty risky if that content comes fresh from your
users.** Never trust user input!

### Tag Interpolation

Interpolation works with **Phug** as well.
Just use the tag interpolation syntax, like so:

```phug
p.
  This is a very long and boring paragraph that spans multiple lines.
  Suddenly there is a #[strong strongly worded phrase] that cannot be
  #[em ignored].
p.
  And here's an example of an interpolated tag with an attribute:
  #[q(lang="es") ¡Hola Mundo!]
```

Wrap an inline **Phug** tag declaration in `#[` and `]`, and it'll be
evaluated and buffered into the content of its containing tag.

### Whitespace Control

The tag interpolation syntax is especially useful for inline tags,
where whitespace before and after the tag is significant.

By default, however, **Phug** removes all spaces before and after tags.
Check out the following example:

```phug
p
  | If I don't write the paragraph with tag interpolation, tags like
  strong strong
  | and
  em em
  | might produce unexpected results.
p.
  If I do, whitespace is #[strong respected] and #[em everybody] is happy.
```

See the section [Plain Text](#plain-text)
for more information and examples on this topic.

## Iteration

**Phug** supports two primary methods of iteration: `each` and `while`.

### each

`each` is the easiest way to iterate over arrays and objects in
a template:

PHP-style:
```phug
ul
  each $val in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    li= $val
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
ul
  each val in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    li= val
```

You can also get the index as you iterate:

PHP-style:
```phug
ul
  each $val, $index in ['zero', 'one', 'two']
    li= $index . ': ' . $val
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
ul
  each val, index in ['zero', 'one', 'two']
    li= index + ': ' + val
```

**Phug** also lets you iterate over the keys in an object:

PHP-style:
```phug
ul
  each $val, $index in (object) ['one' => 'ONE', 'two' => 'TWO', 'three' => 'THREE']
    li= $index . ': ' . $val
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
ul
  each val, index in {one: 'ONE', two: 'TWO', three: 'THREE'}
    li= index + ': ' + val
```

The object or array to iterate over can be a variable, or the
result of a function call, or almost anything else.

PHP-style:
```phug
- $values = []
ul
  each $val in count($values) ? $values : ['There are no values']
    li= $val
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
- var values = [];
ul
  each val in values.length ? values : ['There are no values']
    li= val
```

One can also add an `else` block that will be executed if the array
or object does not contain values to iterate over. The following
is equivalent to the example above:

PHP-style:
```phug
- $values = []
ul
  each $val in $values
    li= $val
  else
    li There are no values
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
- var values = [];
ul
  each val in values
    li= val
  else
    li There are no values
```

You can also use `for` as an alias of `each`.

A special feature of **Phug** (not available in pugjs) also allow you
to use `for` like a PHP for loop:

```phug
ul
  for $n = 0; $n &lt; 4; $n++
    li= $n
```

Last note about the iterations variables scope:
be aware they erase previous variables with the
same names:
```phug
- $index = 'foo'
- $value = 'bar'
each $value, $index in ['key' => 'value']
| $index = #{$index}
| $value = #{$value}
```

### while

You can also use `while` to create a loop:

```phug
- $n = 0
ul
  while $n &lt; 4
    li= $n++
```

## Mixins

Mixins allow you to create reusable blocks of **Phug**.

```phug
//- Declaration
mixin list
  ul
    li foo
    li bar
    li baz
//- Use
+list
+list
```

Mixins are compiled to functions, and can take arguments:
```phug
mixin pet($name)
  li.pet= $name
ul
  +pet('cat')
  +pet('dog')
  +pet('pig')
```

No need to prefix parameters/variables with `$` if you
[use JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions)

### Mixin Blocks

Mixins can also take a block of **Phug** to act as the content:

```phug
mixin article($title)
  .article
    .article-wrapper
      h1= $title
      if $block
        block
      else
        p No content provided

+article('Hello world')

+article('Hello world')
  p This is my
  p Amazing article
```

No need to prefix parameters/variables with `$` if you
[use JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions)

**Important**: in pugjs, the `block` variable is a function
representation of the block. In **Phug**, we just pass a
boolean as an helper to know if the mixin call has children
elements. So you can use `$block` anywhere inside the mixin
declaration (or just `block` if you
[use JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions)) and you will
get `true` if the block is filled, `false` if it's empty.

### Mixin Attributes

Mixins also get an implicit `attributes` argument, which is
taken from the attributes passed to the mixin:

PHP-style:
```phug
mixin link($href, $name)
  //- attributes == {class: "btn"}
  a(class!=$attributes['class'], href=$href)= $name

+link('/foo', 'foo')(class="btn")
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
- var values = [];
mixin link(href, name)
  //- attributes == {class: "btn"}
  a(class!=attributes.class href=href)= name

+link('/foo', 'foo')(class="btn")
```

**Note: The values in `attributes` by default are already
escaped!** You should use `!=` to avoid escaping them a second
time. (See also [unescaped attributes](#unescaped-attributes).)

You can also use mixins with [`&attributes`](#language-reference-attributes):

PHP-style:
```phug
mixin link($href, $name)
  a(href=$href)&attributes($attributes)= $name

+link('/foo', 'foo')(class="btn")
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
mixin link(href, name)
  a(href=href)&attributes(attributes)= name

+link('/foo', 'foo')(class="btn")
```

**Note:** The syntax `+link(class="btn")` is also valid and equivalent
to `+link()(class="btn")`, since **Phug** tries to detect if parentheses’
contents are attributes or arguments. Nevertheless, we encourage you
to use the second syntax, as you pass explicitly no arguments and you
ensure the first parenthesis is the arguments list.

### Rest Arguments

You can write mixins that take an unknown number of arguments using the
“rest arguments” syntax.


PHP-style:
```phug
mixin list($id, ...$items)
  ul(id=$id)
    each $item in $items
      li= $item

+list('my-list', 1, 2, 3, 4)
```

[JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions):
```pug
mixin list(id, ...items)
  ul(id=id)
    each item in items
      li= item

+list('my-list', 1, 2, 3, 4)
```

## Plain Text

**Phug** provides four ways of getting *plain text* — that is, any code
or text content that should go, mostly unprocessed, directly into
the rendered HTML. They are useful in different situations.

Plain text does still allow tag and string
[interpolation](#interpolation), but because plain
text is not escaped, you can also include literal HTML.

One common pitfall here is managing whitespace in the rendered
HTML. We'll talk about that at the end of this chapter.

### Inline in a Tag

The easiest way to add plain text is *inline*. The first term
on the line is the tag itself. Everything after the tag and
one space will be the text contents of that tag. This is
most useful when the plain text content is short (or if
you don't mind lines running long).

```phug
p This is plain old &lt;em>text&lt;/em> content.
```

### Literal HTML

Whole lines are also treated as plain text when they begin with a
left angle bracket (`<`), which may occasionally be useful for writing
literal HTML tags in places that could otherwise be inconvenient.
For example, one use case is
[conditional comments](#conditional-comments).
Since literal HTML tags do not get processed, they do not
self-close, unlike **Phug** tags.

```phug
&lt;html>

body
  p Both open and close of the html tag are considered
  p as a line of literal HTML.

&lt;/html>
```

**Warning:** In **pugjs**, indent the content (body in this example)
has no incidence. In **pugjs**, only lines starting with `&lt;`
are literal HTML no mater the indent.

But in **Phug** (and so **pug-php** too), we consider that indented
content after a line starting with `&lt;` is also literal HTML and
so not processed, so if you indent `body` in this example, it will
become unprocessed text content of the `<html>` tag.  

This feature allow you to copy-paste indented HTML as it from
anywhere to your templates:

```phug
.foo
  #bar
    &lt;p>
      Unprocessed text #{'except for interpolations'}
    &lt;/p>
    &lt;p>
      Title
      &lt;a href="/link">
        Button
      &lt;/a>
    &lt;/p>
    p This is #[strong Phug] code again
```

### Piped Text

Another way to add plain text to templates is to prefix a line
with a pipe character (`|`). This method is useful for mixing
plain text with inline tags, as we discuss later, in the
Whitespace Control section.

```phug
p
  | The pipe always goes at the beginning of its own line,
  | not counting indentation.
```

### Block in a Tag

Often you might want large blocks of text within a tag.
A good example is writing JavaScript and CSS code in
the `script` and `style` tags. To do this, just add a `.`
right after the tag name, or after the closing parenthesis,
if the tag has [attributes](#attributes).

There should be no space between the tag and the dot.
Plain text contents of the tag must be indented one level:

```phug
script.
  if (usingPug)
    console.log('you are awesome')
  else
    console.log('use pug')
```

You can also create a dot block of plain text *after* other
tags within the parent tag.

```phug
div
  p This text belongs to the paragraph tag.
  br
  .
    This text belongs to the div tag.
```

### Whitespace Control

Managing the whitespace of the rendered HTML is one of the
trickiest parts about learning Pug. Don't worry, though,
you'll get the hang of it soon enough.

You just need to remember two main points about how whitespace
works. When compiling to HTML:

 1. **Phug** removes *indentation*, and all whitespace
 *between* elements.
    - So, the closing tag of an HTML element will touch
    the opening tag of the next. This is generally not a
    problem for block-level elements like paragraphs,
    because they will still render as separate paragraphs
    in the web browser (unless you have changed their CSS
    `display` property). See the methods described below,
    however, for when you do need to insert space between
    elements.
 2. **Phug** *preserves* whitespace *within* elements,
 including:
    - all whitespace in the middle of a line of text,
    - leading whitespace beyond the block indentation,
    - trailing whitespace,
    - line breaks within a plain text block.

So… **Phug** drops the whitespace between tags, but keeps
the whitespace inside them. The value here is that it gives
you full control over whether tags and/or plain text should
touch. It even lets you place tags in the middle of words.

```phug
| You put the em
em pha
| sis on the wrong syl
em la
| ble.
```

The trade-off is that it *requires* you to think about and
take control over whether tags and text touch.

If you need the text and/or tags to touch — perhaps you
need a period to appear outside the hyperlink at the end
of a sentence — this is easy, as it’s basically what
happens unless you tell **Phug** otherwise.

```phug
a ...sentence ending with a link
| .
```

If you need to *add* space, you have a few options:

### Recommended Solutions

You could add one or more empty piped lines — a pipe
with either spaces or nothing after it. This will
insert whitespace in the rendered HTML.

```phug
| Don't
|
button#self-destruct touch
|
| me!
```

If your inline tags don’t require many attributes,
you may find it easiest to use tag interpolation,
or literal HTML, within a plain text *block*.

```phug
p.
  Using regular tags can help keep your lines short,
  but interpolated tags may be easier to #[em visualize]
  whether the tags and text are whitespace-separated.
```

### Not recommended

Depending on where you need the whitespace, you
could add an extra space at the beginning of the
text (after the block indentation, pipe character,
and/or tag). Or you could add a trailing space
at the *end* of the text.

**NOTE the trailing and leading spaces here:**

```phug
| Hey, check out 
a(href="http://example.biz/kitten.png") this picture
|  of my cat!
```

The above solution works perfectly well, but is
admittedly perhaps a little dangerous: many code
editors by default will *remove* trailing whitespace
on save. You and all your contributors may have
to configure your editors to prevent automatic
trailing whitespace removal.

## Tags

By default, text at the start of a line (or after
only white space) represents an HTML tag. Indented
tags are nested, creating the tree structure of
HTML.

```phug
ul
  li Item A
  li Item B
  li Item C
```

**Phug** also knows which elements are self-closing:

```phug
img
```

### Block Expansion

To save space, **Phug** provides an inline syntax
for nested tags.

```phug
a: img
```

### Self-Closing Tags

Tags such as `img`, `meta`, and `link` are automatically
self-closing (unless you use the XML doctype).

You can also explicitly self close a tag by appending
the `/` character. Only do this if you know what
you're doing.

```phug
foo/
foo(bar='baz')/
```

### Rendered Whitespace

Whitespace is removed from the beginning and end
of tags, so that you have control over whether
the rendered HTML elements touch or not. Whitespace
control is generally handled via
[plain text](#plain-text).

## JS-style expressions

By [using JS-style](#use-javascript-expressions)
You no longer need `$` in front of your variables
but this is just the beginning of the amazing
transformations provided by **js-phpize**. Here is a
list of more advanced features:

### Chaining
```pug
- foo = {bar: [{biz: [42]}]}

p=foo.bar[0].biz[0]
```

### Array/object access
```pug
:php
  $obj = (object) ['foo' => 'bar'];
  $arr = ['foo' => 'bar'];

p=obj.foo
p=arr.foo
p=obj['foo']
p=arr['foo']
```

### Method post-pone call
```pug
:php
  class Foo
  {
    public function bar()
    {
      return 42;
    }
  }

  $foo = new Foo;

- method = foo.bar

p=method()
```

### Getter call
```pug
:php
  class Foo
  {
    public function __isset($name)
    {
      return $name === 'abc';
    }

    public function __get($name)
    {
      return "magic getter for $name";
    }

    public function getBar()
    {
      return 42;
    }
  }

  $foo = new Foo;

p=foo.bar
p=foo['bar']
p=foo.abc
p=foo['abc']
p=foo.nothandled
p=foo['nothandled']
```
```pug
:php
  class Machin implements ArrayAccess
  {
    public function offsetExists($name)
    {
      return $name === 'abc';
    }

    public function offsetGet($name)
    {
      return "magic getter for $name";
    }

    public function offsetSet($name, $value) {}

    public function offsetUnset($name) {}

    public function getTruc()
    {
      return 42;
    }
  }

  $machin = new Machin;

p=machin.truc
p=machin['truc']
p=machin.abc
p=machin['abc']
p=machin.nongere
p=machin['nongere']
```

### Closure
```pug
p=implode(', ', array_filter([1, 2, 3], function (number) {
  return number % 2 === 1;
}))
```

### Array.prototype emulation
```pug
- arr = [1, 2, 3]
p=arr.length
p=arr.filter(nombre => nombre & 1).join(', ')
p=arr.indexOf(2)
p=arr.slice(1).join('/')
p=arr.reverse().join(', ')
p=arr.splice(1, 2).join(', ')
p=arr.reduce((i, n) => i + n)
p=arr.map(n => n * 2).join(', ')
- arr.forEach(function (num) {
  div=num
- })
//- Yes all that is converted into PHP
```

### String.prototype emulation
```pug
- text = "abcdef"
p=text.length
p=text[1]
p=text[-1]
p=text.substr(2, 3)
p=text.charAt(3)
p=text.indexOf('c')
p=text.toUpperCase()
p=text.toUpperCase().toLowerCase()
p=text.match('d')
p=text.split(/[ce]/).join(', ')
p=text.replace(/(a|e)/, '.')
```
